Memberships 
=========================

In the BitShares, there are two types of Membership Groups. Everyone becomes a Basic account member when created new BitShares account. Then, you can upgrade to a Lifetime membership (LTM) account. The **Lifetime member** (LTM) account gives the options and benefits to all BitShares holders.  


---------------

Membership Group Types
-----------------------------

:Basic Account Members:  A regular default account. It's free, but not qualify for any cashback on transaction fees.

:Lifetime Members: One time upgrade fee is required. Lifetime Members get a percentage cashback on every transaction fee they pay and income from referrals (Referral Program). 

:(Annual Members):  This membership has been removed. (*see the below notes) 

To find out your Membership stats on the BitShares UI wallet, go to your account menu and select **Membership stats**.  You can find your current membership status and the *upgrade fee* to become a LTM. 


.. note:: In Q1/2016, the *annual membership* has been removed from the code base and no longer exists. References to this kind of memberships can be safely ignored.

.. note:: Due to some discrepancies, the annual membership has been disabled in most web wallets and will be re-enabled after a proper update eventually.

Tools
-----------

This tool allows you to check BitShares blockchain detailed health. You can observe the BitShares blockchain operations/transactions, maeket volumes, assets, and fees. Also you can search "block", "Account", "Object", "Asset", and Transaction by the ID. 

.. Note:: In the Testnet explorer, you may not find many activities. If you want to see the currest activities, pleaser check the Mainnet Explorer.

* **Bitshares Blockchain Explorer for Testnet:** http://bitshares-testnet.xyz/ 
  
The below API tools allow you to try BitShares APIs. You can set a value and click [Try it out!], then you will get a return. The return include a used Curl path format, Requested URL, and Response Body. Those information are very valuable to learn BitShares. 


* APIs - the Teatnet Explorer uses to query the **Testnet**

Public Testnet Genesis file 
===================================

As you know, each blockchain starts with a genesis block that definitions are in a genesis file. The bitshares-core-testnet has already prepared **a genesis.json file for the Public Testnet.**  Unless you want to adjust parameter values, you will not need to modify the public testnet genesis.json file.

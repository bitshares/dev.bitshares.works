Blockchain Interaction
************************

To interface your existing platform with BitShares, you can make use of :ref:`rpc` and :ref:`websocket-calls` to either a :ref:`full-node` (for monitoring only) or the :ref:`cli-wallet` (for accessing funds). 

All API calls are formated in JSON and return JSON only. You can read more about the API in :ref:`this section <api-access-and-restrictions>`.

The BitShares toolkit comprises several tools that allow interaction with the blockchain on different levels and has been described briefly in the following sections.

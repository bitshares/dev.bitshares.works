Investor Guide
====================



.. note:: This guide is still under construction. Please excuse if what
          you are searching for is not yet available

The investor guide serves as an entry point for existing and potential
investors in the BitShares ecosystem. We here merely discuss the BTS
token as well as investment opportunities available within BitShares
itself and deliberately do not advertise 3rd party businesses. Please be
reminded that this is an information platform and thus we do not give
investment advice.


Claim your Investment
----------------------------

You are considered as a AngelShare holder if you have donated BTC or BTS
to one of these addresses:

* **BTC**: ``1ANGELwQwWxMmbdaSWhWLqBEtPTkWb8uDc``
* **PTS**: ``PaNGELmZgzRQCKeEKM6ifgTqNkC4ceiAWw``

There is also an `AngelShare Explorer <http://www1.agsexplorer.com/>`_
specifically for these donations

AngelShares have been gifted 50% of the initial BTS shares. The other
50% went to AngelShares, the other went to holders of PTS.

Claiming your Stake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to claim your BTS, you need to look in your bitcoin wallet and
search for transactions the the above mentioned address. The keys that
correspond to the inputs of that transaction are what you need to obtain
your BTS (`FAQ <http://www1.agsexplorer.com/ags101>`).

If you have located the private keys (in wallet import format - WIF),
you can safely import them into your BitShares account using the *Import
Keys* tools in the Wallet Management Console of your BitShares wallet.

If, however, you only have a `wallet.dat` file, you will need to

1. install BitShares 0.9.3
2. create an account in the BitShares 0.9.3 wallet
3. import the `wallet.dat` file into your account
4. :ref:`export a BitShares 2.0 compatible backup file <howto-exporting-wallet>`
5. :ref:`import the new backup into BitShares 2.0 <howto-importing-wallet>`
6. :ref:`claim you funds from the BitShares 2.0 genesis block <howto-importing-wallet>`

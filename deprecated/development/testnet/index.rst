Testnets
******************************************************************

This page is dedicated to *testnets*. We distinguish between our
**public testnet** that has been deployed and is fully functional for
anyone to use and is shared among developers, and **private testnets**
that every developer could easily deploy at home to benefit from
extra low latency and additional super powers over the network.


Guides about how to deploy a public, or a private network are
presented in separated tutorials:

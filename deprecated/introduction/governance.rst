Governance
================

On the BitShares Blockchain, decisions are made by the holders of BTS core native token weighted by the amount of BTS owned. In order to improve voting participation and simplify the life of BTS holders, voters can either vote directly or delegate voting power to so called​proxies. This is similar to a representative democracy, where elected leaders decide the course of action. Those leaders have to account for their actions and can be unelected by the core token holders. Unwanted actions includes censoring, favoring, or simply failure to produce blocks in a timely manner. However, the difference to a democracy is that voters in the community have their vote weighted by the amount of BTS that they own in their account. 
 
At any time, voters have to decide on the following aspects of the BitShares Blockchain: 

Members for Block Production (Witnesses) 
----------------------------------------
Block production in BitShares is arranged through DPoS which requires block producers to run for witness and campaign for sufficient votes from BTS holders before they can produce blocks on the blockchain and consequently get paid per produced block. Given the governance system and quick re-tallying of votes, a misbehaving block producer can be fired within hours. Next to the actual selection of block producers, the voters also have a say over how many block producers should exist. 


Members for Blockchain Governance (Committee) 
---------------------------------------------
The Committee comprises a board that has control over a few blockchain parameters such as block size, block time, witness pay, and over 30 others. Additionally, the committee can change the fee schedule which defines the minimum fee for each operation offered by the system. Voters can cast a vote for how many members the committee should constitute as well as vote for a particular set of members.

Project Funding (Workers) 
-------------------------
Last but not least, the voters have control over who receives funding from the Working Budget of the Blockchain. A worker applies for project funding and needs to campaign for sufficient votes before being paid. Similar to block producers and committee members, the rigorous voting system allows fast removal by BTS holders and proxies.
